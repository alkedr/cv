    # Concerned about existential risks from AI, looking for ways to make a positive impact.
    experience:
      - company: Yandex, YandexGPT training infrastructure
        position: Senior Software Engineer
        start_date: 2024-04
        highlights:
          - Sped up model checkpoint uploading during training 2x to make it possible to make checkpoints more often and lose less progress after hardware failures.
          - Wrote a tool for benchmarking different methods of checkpoint uploading.

      - company: Yandex, SportTechCV infrastructure
        position: Senior Software Engineer
        start_date: 2023-09
        end_date: 2024-04
        highlights:
          - Designed and implemented a real-time video processing pipeline for tracking player movements on a football field. Was responsible for real-time processing infrastructure and used CV algorithms developed by another team as a black box. Python, PostgreSQL, a message queue similar to Kafka, FFmpeg.
          - Wrote a tool for visualizing the progress of each video chunk in real-time.

      - company: Yandex, VR and 3D reconstruction infrastructure
        position: Senior Software Engineer

        end_date: 2023-09
        highlights:
          - Sped up video 3D reconstruction pipeline 4x by finding and fixing infrastructural issues and profiling with Torch profiler.
          - Researched and tested alternatives to the differentiable 3D-renderer that we were using. Nvdiffrast, Mitsuba 3, Pytorch3d.
          - Wrote a tool for converting reconstructed animated 3D model back into video for easy viewing.

      - company: Yandex, Self-driving cars simulator testing infrastructure
        position: Software Engineer
        start_date: 2020-05
        end_date: 2022-11
        highlights:
          - Designed and implemented a task queue service for launching simulator tests that could scale to thousands of workers. Python, PostgreSQL.
          - Designed, prototyped, and helped implement an inference server cluster that could handle to >12k RPS and tens of GBit/s of incoming traffic, and could scale the number of its instances based on the current load. Python, C++, Nvidia Triton Inference Server.

      - company: Yandex, Yandex.Market infrastructure
        position: Software Engineer
